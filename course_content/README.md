# Raspberrypi-course
- This information applies to every session and is a more general description of the course

## Topics:

## Duration:
1.5 Hours

## Materials required:
- it is a good idea to come with a laptop or at the bare minimu, a cellphone. Even better is to already set up and use Linux on a device.  
You can take a look at my other Repo for a step by step guide. Check out the [CLI Repo](https://github.com/444B/CLI) and head to the right section according to the device you intend to use.
- Please note that it is also entirely possible to connect to the PI using SSH so technically any device will do.

## Recommended knowledge:
- Basic Linux commands (cd, ls, nano, rm, ssh, very basic git) 
- very basic networking skills (what is wifi and what is an IP address)

## Notes:
- If you are lacking some of the knowledge mentioned above, come and learn! We love sharing :)
